# 3D-Face-Projection-from-landmarks
Some script using the 3D MatPlotLib and the DLib 68 face landmarks detection.

Sunday project. Not very professional. A lot of unnecessary generators and loops, but works.

The x and y coordinates are taken from the landmarks and z is precomputed. I have Blender, I imported a face model, recreated the landmarks positions, estimate the z height in the face model and get the z coordinates for each point. Â¿Is there another way to do it? Life's full of unanswered questions...
